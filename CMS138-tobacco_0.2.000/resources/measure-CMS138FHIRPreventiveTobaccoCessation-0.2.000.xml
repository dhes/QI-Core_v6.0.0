                  <td class="content-container">This measure is intended to promote adult tobacco screening and tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) is successful in helping tobacco users quit. Tobacco users who are able to stop using tobacco lower their risk for heart disease, lung disease, and stroke.</td>

                  <th scope="row" class="row-header">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th> 
                  <td class="content-container">The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021).

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021). 

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who use tobacco to other tobacco cessation interventions with proven effectiveness and established safety (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021). The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (Grade B Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2020).

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care--feasible interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2020). All patients should be asked if they use tobacco and should have their tobacco use status documented on a regular basis. Evidence has shown that clinic screening systems, such as expanding the vital signs to include tobacco use status or the use of other reminder systems such as chart stickers or computer prompts, significantly increase rates of clinician intervention. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).

All physicians should strongly advise every patient who smokes to quit because evidence shows that physician advice to quit smoking increases abstinence rates. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008). Minimal interventions lasting less than 3 minutes increase overall tobacco abstinence rates. Every tobacco user should be offered at least a minimal intervention, whether or not he or she is referred to an intensive intervention. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).

The combination of counseling and medication is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone. Therefore, whenever feasible and appropriate, both counseling and medication should be provided to patients trying to quit smoking. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).</td>

                  <td class="content-container">The requirement of two or more visits is to establish that the eligible clinician has an existing relationship with the patient for certain types of encounters. 

To satisfy the intent of this measure, a patient must have at least one tobacco use screening during the measurement period. If a patient has multiple tobacco use screenings during the measurement period, only the most recent screening, which has a documented status of tobacco user or tobacco non-user, will be used to satisfy the measure requirements. If a patient uses any type of tobacco (i.e., smokes or uses smokeless tobacco), the expectation is that they should receive tobacco cessation intervention: either counseling and/or pharmacotherapy.

As noted above in the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for tobacco cessation. However, as noted above in the Definition section, the 2021 USPSTF recommendation also references the US Food and Drug Administration definition of tobacco, which includes e-cigarettes, hookah pens and other electronic nicotine delivery systems. Therefore, the measure does consider the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems to be tobacco use. If a patient's tobacco use status is unknown, the patient does not meet the screening requirement and does not meet the numerator for populations 1 or 3. Instances where tobacco use status of "unknown" include: 1) the patient was not screened; or 2) the patient was screened and the patient (or caregiver) was unable to provide a definitive answer.

In order to promote a team-based approach to patient care, the tobacco cessation intervention can be performed by another healthcare provider; therefore, the tobacco use screening and tobacco cessation intervention do not need to be performed by the same provider or clinician.  This measure contains three reporting rates which aim to identify patients who were screened for tobacco use (rate/population 1), patients who were identified as tobacco users and who received a tobacco cessation intervention (rate/population 2), and a comprehensive look at the overall performance on tobacco screening and cessation intervention (rate/population 3). By separating this measure into various reporting rates, the eligible clinician will be able to better ascertain where gaps in performance exist, and identify opportunities for improvement. The overall rate (rate/population 3) can be utilized to compare performance to published versions of this measure prior to the 2018 performance year, when the measure had a single performance rate. For accountability reporting in the CMS MIPS program, the rate for population 2 is used for performance.  The denominator of population criteria 2 is a subset of the resulting numerator for population criteria 1, as population criteria 2 is limited to assessing if patients identified as tobacco users received an appropriate tobacco cessation intervention. For all patients, population criteria 1 and 3 are applicable, but population criteria 2 will only be applicable for those patients who are identified as tobacco users. Therefore, data for every patient that meets the initial population criteria will only be submitted for population 1 and 3, whereas data submitted for population 2 will be for a subset of patients who meet the initial population criteria, as the denominator has been further limited to those who were identified as tobacco users. This eCQM is a patient-based measure.

This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS138v13.

@description: Normalizes a value that is a choice of timing-valued types to an equivalent interval
@comment: Normalizes a choice type of DateTime, Quanitty, Interval&lt;DateTime&gt;, or Interval&lt;Quantity&gt; types
to an equivalent interval. This selection of choice types is a superset of the majority of choice types that are used as possible
representations for timing-valued elements in QICore, allowing this function to be used across any resource.
The input can be provided as a DateTime, Quantity, Interval&lt;DateTime&gt; or Interval&lt;Quantity&gt;.
The intent of this function is to provide a clear and concise mechanism to treat single
elements that have multiple possible representations as intervals so that logic doesn't have to account
for the variability. More complex calculations (such as medication request period or dispense period
calculation) need specific guidance and consideration. That guidance may make use of this function, but
the focus of this function is on single element calculations where the semantics are unambiguous.
If the input is a DateTime, the result a DateTime Interval beginning and ending on that DateTime.
If the input is a Quantity, the quantity is expected to be a calendar-duration interpreted as an Age,
and the result is a DateTime Interval beginning on the Date the patient turned that age and ending immediately before one year later.
If the input is a DateTime Interval, the result is the input.
If the input is a Quantity Interval, the quantities are expected to be calendar-durations interpreted as an Age, and the result
is a DateTime Interval beginning on the date the patient turned the age given as the start of the quantity interval, and ending
immediately before one year later than the date the patient turned the age given as the end of the quantity interval.
If the input is a Timing, an error will be thrown indicating that Timing calculations are not implemented. Any other input will reslt in a null DateTime Interval

@description: Normalizes a value that is a choice of timing-valued types to an equivalent interval
@comment: Normalizes a choice type of DateTime, Quanitty, Interval&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt;, or Interval&amp;lt;Quantity&amp;gt; types
to an equivalent interval. This selection of choice types is a superset of the majority of choice types that are used as possible
representations for timing-valued elements in QICore, allowing this function to be used across any resource.
The input can be provided as a DateTime, Quantity, Interval&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt; or Interval&amp;lt;Quantity&amp;gt;.
The intent of this function is to provide a clear and concise mechanism to treat single
elements that have multiple possible representations as intervals so that logic doesn&amp;#39;t have to account
for the variability. More complex calculations (such as medication request period or dispense period
calculation) need specific guidance and consideration. That guidance may make use of this function, but
the focus of this function is on single element calculations where the semantics are unambiguous.
If the input is a DateTime, the result a DateTime Interval beginning and ending on that DateTime.
If the input is a Quantity, the quantity is expected to be a calendar-duration interpreted as an Age,
and the result is a DateTime Interval beginning on the Date the patient turned that age and ending immediately before one year later.
If the input is a DateTime Interval, the result is the input.
If the input is a Quantity Interval, the quantities are expected to be calendar-durations interpreted as an Age, and the result
is a DateTime Interval beginning on the date the patient turned the age given as the start of the quantity interval, and ending
immediately before one year later than the date the patient turned the age given as the end of the quantity interval.
If the input is a Timing, an error will be thrown indicating that Timing calculations are not implemented. Any other input will reslt in a null DateTime Interval

 Goal is to get to number of days
 Two broad approaches to the calculation:
  1) Based on supply and frequency, calculate the number of expected days the medication will cover/has covered

This topic covers several use cases and illustrates how to calculate Cumulative

   <description value="Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older who were screened for tobacco use one or more times during the measurement period AND who received tobacco cessation intervention during the measurement period or in the six months prior to the measurement period if identified as a tobacco user.

Three rates are reported: 
a. Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older who were screened for tobacco use one or more times during the measurement period
b. Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older who were identified as a tobacco user during the measurement period who received tobacco cessation intervention during the measurement period or in the six months prior to the measurement period 
c. Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older who were screened for tobacco use one or more times during the measurement period AND who received tobacco cessation intervention during the measurement period or in the six months prior to the measurement period if identified as a tobacco user"></description>
   <usage value="The requirement of two or more visits is to establish that the eligible clinician has an existing relationship with the patient for certain types of encounters. 

To satisfy the intent of this measure, a patient must have at least one tobacco use screening during the measurement period. If a patient has multiple tobacco use screenings during the measurement period, only the most recent screening, which has a documented status of tobacco user or tobacco non-user, will be used to satisfy the measure requirements.

If a patient uses any type of tobacco (i.e., smokes or uses smokeless tobacco), the expectation is that they should receive tobacco cessation intervention: either counseling and/or pharmacotherapy.

As noted above in the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for tobacco cessation. However, as noted above in the Definition section, the 2021 USPSTF recommendation also references the US Food and Drug Administration definition of tobacco, which includes e-cigarettes, hookah pens and other electronic nicotine delivery systems. Therefore, the measure does consider the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems to be tobacco use.

If a patient's tobacco use status is unknown, the patient does not meet the screening requirement and does not meet the numerator for populations 1 or 3. Instances where tobacco use status of &quot;unknown&quot; include: 1) the patient was not screened; or 2) the patient was screened and the patient (or caregiver) was unable to provide a definitive answer.

In order to promote a team-based approach to patient care, the tobacco cessation intervention can be performed by another healthcare provider; therefore, the tobacco use screening and tobacco cessation intervention do not need to be performed by the same provider or clinician.   

This measure contains three reporting rates which aim to identify patients who were screened for tobacco use (rate/population 1), patients who were identified as tobacco users and who received a tobacco cessation intervention (rate/population 2), and a comprehensive look at the overall performance on tobacco screening and cessation intervention (rate/population 3). By separating this measure into various reporting rates, the eligible clinician will be able to better ascertain where gaps in performance exist, and identify opportunities for improvement. The overall rate (rate/population 3) can be utilized to compare performance to published versions of this measure prior to the 2018 performance year, when the measure had a single performance rate. For accountability reporting in the CMS MIPS program, the rate for population 2 is used for performance.
 
The denominator of population criteria 2 is a subset of the resulting numerator for population criteria 1, as population criteria 2 is limited to assessing if patients identified as tobacco users received an appropriate tobacco cessation intervention. For all patients, population criteria 1 and 3 are applicable, but population criteria 2 will only be applicable for those patients who are identified as tobacco users. Therefore, data for every patient that meets the initial population criteria will only be submitted for population 1 and 3, whereas data submitted for population 2 will be for a subset of patients who meet the initial population criteria, as the denominator has been further limited to those who were identified as tobacco users.

This eCQM is a patient-based measure.

This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS138v13.

   <rationale value="This measure is intended to promote adult tobacco screening and tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) is successful in helping tobacco users quit. Tobacco users who are able to stop using tobacco lower their risk for heart disease, lung disease, and stroke."></rationale>
   <clinicalRecommendationStatement value="The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021).

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco (Grade A Recommendation) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021).

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021). 

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who use tobacco to other tobacco cessation interventions with proven effectiveness and established safety (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021).

The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (Grade B Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2020).

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care--feasible interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (Grade I Statement) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2020).

All patients should be asked if they use tobacco and should have their tobacco use status documented on a regular basis. Evidence has shown that clinic screening systems, such as expanding the vital signs to include tobacco use status or the use of other reminder systems such as chart stickers or computer prompts, significantly increase rates of clinician intervention. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).

All physicians should strongly advise every patient who smokes to quit because evidence shows that physician advice to quit smoking increases abstinence rates. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).

Minimal interventions lasting less than 3 minutes increase overall tobacco abstinence rates. Every tobacco user should be offered at least a minimal intervention, whether or not he or she is referred to an intensive intervention. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008).

The combination of counseling and medication is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone. Therefore, whenever feasible and appropriate, both counseling and medication should be provided to patients trying to quit smoking. (Strength of Evidence = A) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service, 2008)."></clinicalRecommendationStatement>
   <guidance value="The requirement of two or more visits is to establish that the eligible clinician has an existing relationship with the patient for certain types of encounters. 

To satisfy the intent of this measure, a patient must have at least one tobacco use screening during the measurement period. If a patient has multiple tobacco use screenings during the measurement period, only the most recent screening, which has a documented status of tobacco user or tobacco non-user, will be used to satisfy the measure requirements.

If a patient uses any type of tobacco (i.e., smokes or uses smokeless tobacco), the expectation is that they should receive tobacco cessation intervention: either counseling and/or pharmacotherapy.

As noted above in the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for tobacco cessation. However, as noted above in the Definition section, the 2021 USPSTF recommendation also references the US Food and Drug Administration definition of tobacco, which includes e-cigarettes, hookah pens and other electronic nicotine delivery systems. Therefore, the measure does consider the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems to be tobacco use.

If a patient's tobacco use status is unknown, the patient does not meet the screening requirement and does not meet the numerator for populations 1 or 3. Instances where tobacco use status of &quot;unknown&quot; include: 1) the patient was not screened; or 2) the patient was screened and the patient (or caregiver) was unable to provide a definitive answer.

In order to promote a team-based approach to patient care, the tobacco cessation intervention can be performed by another healthcare provider; therefore, the tobacco use screening and tobacco cessation intervention do not need to be performed by the same provider or clinician.   

This measure contains three reporting rates which aim to identify patients who were screened for tobacco use (rate/population 1), patients who were identified as tobacco users and who received a tobacco cessation intervention (rate/population 2), and a comprehensive look at the overall performance on tobacco screening and cessation intervention (rate/population 3). By separating this measure into various reporting rates, the eligible clinician will be able to better ascertain where gaps in performance exist, and identify opportunities for improvement. The overall rate (rate/population 3) can be utilized to compare performance to published versions of this measure prior to the 2018 performance year, when the measure had a single performance rate. For accountability reporting in the CMS MIPS program, the rate for population 2 is used for performance.
 
The denominator of population criteria 2 is a subset of the resulting numerator for population criteria 1, as population criteria 2 is limited to assessing if patients identified as tobacco users received an appropriate tobacco cessation intervention. For all patients, population criteria 1 and 3 are applicable, but population criteria 2 will only be applicable for those patients who are identified as tobacco users. Therefore, data for every patient that meets the initial population criteria will only be submitted for population 1 and 3, whereas data submitted for population 2 will be for a subset of patients who meet the initial population criteria, as the denominator has been further limited to those who were identified as tobacco users.

This eCQM is a patient-based measure.

This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS138v13.
