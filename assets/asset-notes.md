The Supplemental Material section of the  CMS Measures Management System (MMS) Hub, which includes the Measure-Calculations.pdf document is located [here](https://mmshub.cms.gov/tools-and-resources/mms-supplemental-materials)

Consider this important [Measure Population Semantics](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-measures/measure-conformance.html#measure-population-semantics) document. Does fqm reference this to explain or justify why they don't alway map "Denominator Exclusion" to *denominator-exclusion*?
