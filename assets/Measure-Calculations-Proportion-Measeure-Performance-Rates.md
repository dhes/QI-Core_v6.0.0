1.1 ELEMENTS OF A PROPORTION MEASURE
    From these relationships and definitions, the measure developer should use these sequential steps to determine whether a patient falls into a given population:
1. Target/Initial population (IP): Identify those patients meeting the IP criteria.
2. Denominator (DENOM): Identify the subset of the IP meeting the DENOM criteria.
3. Denominator exclusion (DENEX): Identify the subset of the DENOM meeting the DENEXcriteria. Remove those that are patients from the denominator as exclusions. After removal of these patients, the remaining subset reflects the group of patients evaluated for the numerator criteria.
4. Numerator (NUMER): Identify those in the DENOM and not in the DENEX meeting the NUMER criteria. In proportion measures, the numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expectedfor each patient, procedure, or other unit of measurement defined in the denominator.
5. Numerator exclusion (NUMEX): Identify the subset of the NUMER meeting the NUMEX criteria. Use NUMEX to define instances not included in the numerator data.
6. Denominator exception (DENEXCEP): Identify those in the DENOM and not in the DENEX and NOT in the NUMER meeting the DENEXCEP criteria. Remove these patients from the IP and/or DENOM.
  
1.2 PERFORMANCE RATES
  Specific programs may require reporting of performance rates. The performance rate is the number of patients meeting NUMER criteria (accounting for exclusions), divided by patients in the DENOM (accounting for exclusion and exception). Calculate the performance rate using the formula

    Performance rate2 = (NUMER – NUMEX) / (DENOM – DENEX – DENEXCEP)
Alternatively,

    Performance rate = (observed rate / expected rate) * population rate
Exception: 0% Performance Rates
- Inverse measures: For inverse measures, a lower rate indicates better performance; measure developers should consider a 0% performance rate as satisfactorily reporting (e.g., 30-day mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction).
- Null Scores: If the measure is not applicable for all patients within the sample, the performance rate would be 0/0 (null) and is considered satisfactorily reporting or having data completeness. Do not count performance exclusion Quality Data Codes (QDCs) in the performance denominator.
